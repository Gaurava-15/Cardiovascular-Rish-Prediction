‚ù§Ô∏è Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

üìå Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) based on patient data. By analyzing various health parameters, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and preventive care.


üéØ Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distributions and relationships.
Modeling: Implement and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.


üìä Dataset
The dataset comprises patient information, including:
Age: Patient's age.
Sex: Gender of the patient.
Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced.
Resting Blood Pressure: Blood pressure at rest.
Serum Cholesterol: Cholesterol level in mg/dl.
Fasting Blood Sugar: Blood sugar level after fasting.
Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Electrocardiographic results at rest.
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
Exercise-Induced Angina: Presence of angina induced by exercise.
Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
Thalassemia: Thalassemia status.

Target: Presence or absence of heart disease.

Note: The exact dataset source and its availability should be specified here.


üõ†Ô∏è Methods
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Impute or remove missing data.
Feature Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats.
Feature Scaling: Normalize features to bring them to a common scale.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize distributions of features.
Analyze correlations between features.
Identify potential outliers and anomalies.


3. Model Implementation
Logistic Regression: A statistical method for binary classification.
Decision Trees: A non-linear model that splits data based on feature values.
Random Forests: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes.


4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.
Recall: Proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
